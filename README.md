# Atliq Bank Customer Insights Project (phase 1)

## Project Overview
This project is all about figuring out which age group Atliq Bank should target for their new credit card. I used a Jupyter Notebook to clean and analyze customer data and created visualizations to present my findings.

## Story
Atliq Bank is planning to launch a new credit card. To ensure its success, they need to know which age group to focus on. This project is the first step in identifying that target audience.

## Objectives
- Identify the best age group to target for the new credit card.
- Clean and organize the data for analysis.
- Handle any unusual data (outliers) to ensure accurate results.
- Use charts to visualize the data and make it easier to understand.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
- **Handling Missing Values**: I fixed any missing data to ensure the dataset was complete.
- **Outlier Treatment**: I identified and managed any unusual data points.
- **Data Transformation**: I made necessary changes to the data for better analysis.

## Data Insights
- **Target Age Group Identification**: I analyzed the data to find the best age group for the new credit card.
- **Data Visualization**: I created charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib to show my findings.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: The main programming language I used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For creating charts.

## Results
- I presented detailed charts of the age distribution and key insights.
- I provided recommendations for targeting the identified age group.

## Conclusion
This project shows how data cleaning, analysis, and visualization can help find valuable insights. The identified age group will be important for Atliq Bank's new credit card launch.
