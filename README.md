# Atliq Bank Customer Insights Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is about helping **Atliq Bank** identify the right age group to target for their new credit card and then evaluating its success after launch.  

- **Phase 1**: Identified the target age group using customer demographic and transaction data.  
- **Phase 2**: After launching the credit card, performed **hypothesis testing (A/B Testing with Z-test)** to check if the new card increased the average transactions.

## 📖 Story  
Atliq Bank planned to launch a new credit card. To ensure success, they first needed to know which age group to focus on (**Phase 1**).  
After launch, they wanted to validate whether the new card was effective in boosting average transactions (**Phase 2**).

## 🎯 Objectives  

### Phase 1  
- Identify the best age group to target for the new credit card.  
- Clean and organize the dataset for analysis.  
- Handle missing values and outliers.  
- Use visualization to clearly present findings.  

### Phase 2  
- Conduct **hypothesis testing (A/B Testing with Z-test)** to check if the new credit card increased average transactions.  
- Compare **control (before launch)** vs **treatment (after launch)** groups.  
- Provide statistical evidence to guide the business decision.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Analysis  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filled or dropped nulls for consistency.  
- **Outlier Treatment**: Removed or capped extreme values.  
- **Data Transformation**: Prepared the dataset for analysis and testing.
